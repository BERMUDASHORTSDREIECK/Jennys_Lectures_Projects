# Jenny's Lectures Python Projects

Based on the video tutorial series [Python - Basic to Advanced](*https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo5W4Nhv31bZSiqiOL5ta39vSnBxpOPT*) 

Starting from [Python Project 2](https://youtu.be/hGuA9WKTtRs?list=PLdo5W4Nhv31bZSiqiOL5ta39vSnBxpOPT)
since the first project is too simple.

Using github trying to figure out how it works \
and to motivate me to stick to programming by making my progress somewhat public.
